            <h2>Criket history</h2>
            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <br />
            <p class="history-para-1">Cricket is believed to have begun possibly as early as the 13th century as a game
                in which country
                boys bowled at a tree stump or at the hurdle gate into a sheep pen. This gate consisted of two
                uprights and a crossbar resting on the slotted tops; the crossbar was called a bail and the entire
                gate a wicket. The fact that the bail could be dislodged when the wicket was struck made this
                preferable to the stump, which name was later applied to the hurdle uprights. Early manuscripts
                differ about the size of the wicket, which acquired a third stump in the 1770s, but by 1706 the
                pitch—the area between the wickets—was 22 yards long.</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">The ball, once presumably a stone, has remained much the same since the 17th
                century. Its modern
                weight of between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (156 and 163 grams) was established in 1774 .</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">The primitive bat was no doubt a shaped branch of a tree, resembling a modern
                hockey stick but
                considerably longer and heavier. The change to a straight bat was made to defend against length
                bowling, which had evolved with cricketers in Hambledon, a small village in southern England. The
                bat was shortened in the handle and straightened and broadened in the blade, which led to forward
                play, driving, and cutting. As bowling technique was not very advanced during this period, batting
                dominated bowling through the 18th century.</p>

            <h2>International Criket</h2><br />
            <p class="history-para-1">International cricket in the early part of the 20th century was dominated by the
                original members of the
                Imperial Cricket Conference, England, Australia, and South Africa. Later renamed the International
                Cricket Conference and then the International Cricket Council, the ICC gradually took over more
                responsibility for the administration of the game and shifted its power base from west to east. When in
                2005 the ICC moved its offices from Lord’s in London—home of the MCC, the game’s original rulers and
                still its lawmakers—to Dubai, the shift away from the old ways of governance was complete. The
                priorities of the game changed too. By the turn of the 21st century, only Australia and England still
                played Test cricket to full houses. Everywhere else, and particularly in India and Pakistan, crowds
                flocked to see limited-overs internationals. Test cricket</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">became almost an afterthought. Although the power to change the laws of the game
                have remained with the MCC, the ICC developed its own Code of Conduct for players, officials, and
                administrators, which sets out disciplinary procedures and protects the spirit of the game. It also
                organized major international tournaments, including the one-day and Twenty20 World Cups and the
                Champions Trophy. In 2000 the ICC set up the Anti-Corruption Unit (renamed the Anti-Corruption Unit and
                Security Unit in 2003) to combat the growing threat of illegal gambling and match fixing. At the
                beginning of the 2010s, the ICC had 10 full members and dozens of associate and affiliate members.</p>
