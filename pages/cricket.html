                <li> A cricket team consists of 11 players. Each team takes turns to bat and bowl.</li>
                <li> A cricket match is divided into innings. Each team gets a chance to bat and bowl. In limited-overs formats, each team usually gets 50 overs to bat.</li>
                <li> The team batting tries to score runs by hitting the ball and running between the wickets. A run is scored each time the batsmen successfully cross each other while running.</li>
                <li>The team bowling aims to dismiss the batsmen and limit the runs scored. The bowler delivers the ball to the batsman, who tries to hit it.</li>
                <li>The batsmen stand at opposite ends of the pitch and try to score runs. They can also hit the ball to the boundary to score four runs, or over the boundary on the full to score six runs.</li>
                <li>In some matches, teams can challenge on-field decisions using DRS, which includes ball-tracking technology and other tools to review decisions like lbw and catches.</li>
