            <h2>Criket history</h2>
            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <br />
            <p class="history-para-1">Cricket is believed to have begun possibly as early as the 13th century as a game
                in which country
                boys bowled at a tree stump or at the hurdle gate into a sheep pen. This gate consisted of two
                uprights and a crossbar resting on the slotted tops; the crossbar was called a bail and the entire
                gate a wicket. The fact that the bail could be dislodged when the wicket was struck made this
                preferable to the stump, which name was later applied to the hurdle uprights. Early manuscripts
                differ about the size of the wicket, which acquired a third stump in the 1770s, but by 1706 the
                pitch—the area between the wickets—was 22 yards long.</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">The ball, once presumably a stone, has remained much the same since the 17th
                century. Its modern
                weight of between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (156 and 163 grams) was established in 1774 .</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">The primitive bat was no doubt a shaped branch of a tree, resembling a modern
                hockey stick but
                considerably longer and heavier. The change to a straight bat was made to defend against length
                bowling, which had evolved with cricketers in Hambledon, a small village in southern England. The
                bat was shortened in the handle and straightened and broadened in the blade, which led to forward
                play, driving, and cutting. As bowling technique was not very advanced during this period, batting
                dominated bowling through the 18th century.</p>

            <h2>International Criket</h2><br />
            <p class="history-para-1">International cricket in the early part of the 20th century was dominated by the
                original members of the
                Imperial Cricket Conference, England, Australia, and South Africa. Later renamed the International
                Cricket Conference and then the International Cricket Council, the ICC gradually took over more
                responsibility for the administration of the game and shifted its power base from west to east. When in
                2005 the ICC moved its offices from Lord’s in London—home of the MCC, the game’s original rulers and
                still its lawmakers—to Dubai, the shift away from the old ways of governance was complete. The
                priorities of the game changed too. By the turn of the 21st century, only Australia and England still
                played Test cricket to full houses. Everywhere else, and particularly in India and Pakistan, crowds
                flocked to see limited-overs internationals. Test cricket</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">became almost an afterthought. Although the power to change the laws of the game
                have remained with the MCC, the ICC developed its own Code of Conduct for players, officials, and
                administrators, which sets out disciplinary procedures and protects the spirit of the game. It also
                organized major international tournaments, including the one-day and Twenty20 World Cups and the
                Champions Trophy. In 2000 the ICC set up the Anti-Corruption Unit (renamed the Anti-Corruption Unit and
                Security Unit in 2003) to combat the growing threat of illegal gambling and match fixing. At the
                beginning of the 2010s, the ICC had 10 full members and dozens of associate and affiliate members.</p>

            <h2>Australia</h2><br />
            <p class="history-para-1">One of the founding members of the ICC, Australia remains one of its most powerful
                countries both on and off the field. The history of cricket in Australia dates to 1803 when the game was
                introduced by the crew of a British ship. The first intercolonial match took place in 1851 between
                Victoria and Tasmania, and by the end of the 19th century teams from England were touring Australia
                regularly. The first official Test match was played in Melbourne in 1877 by Australia and England,
                beginning the oldest rivalry in international cricket, a series that became known as The Ashes (see Test
                Matches below).</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">Cricket is played throughout Australia, and matches are ferociously competitive at
                every level. All the great Australian players from Sir Don Bradman to Shane Warne developed their skills
                in club cricket before graduating to the state and national teams, and the Australian style of cricket
                is marked by aggressiveness with bat, ball, and, often, voice in an attempt to intimidate opponents.
                Through the 20th century, Australia produced a series of outstanding teams, and the country dominated
                international cricket into the new century, winning three successive one-day World Cups (1999–2007) and
                twice recording runs of 16 consecutive Test victories (1999–2001 and 2005–08). In 2005 England’s Test
                victory over Australia, the first since 1987, was celebrated with an open-top bus ride through the city
                of London..</p>

            <h2>Bangladesh</h2><br />

            <br />
            <p class="history-para-1">In June 2000 Bangladesh became the 10th country to be accorded full Test status.
                It
                played its first Test match in November of that year, against India in Dhaka. Known as the Tigers, the
                Bangladeshi team struggled to perform at the highest level, winning only three of its first 68 Tests.
                However, Bangladesh has defeated the nine countries that preceded it to Test status in one-day matches,
                a
                feat completed with a victory over England in Bristol in 2010. Bangladesh’s first appearance in an
                international tournament had come in England in the ICC Trophy competition for associate members in
                1979. In
                1997 Bangladesh won the trophy and qualified for the 1999 World Cup, beating Pakistan in the group
                stages. A
                domestic first-class tournament between six regional teams was established in 2000–01. Since Bangladesh
                gained Test status, cricket arguably has become the most popular sport in the country.</p>

            <h2>India</h2><br />
            <p class="history-para-1">Cricket is played in every corner of India, on city streets, in village fields,
                and on maidans—open playing fields, the largest of which (such as the Azad, Cross, and Oval maidans in
                South Mumbai) can host dozens of overlapping matches. Historically, Indian cricketers have displayed a
                good eye and strong wrists, and Indian batsmen, most notably Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, have
                been some of the most productive and stylish in the history of cricket. The dry flat pitches of the
                subcontinent have also traditionally produced high-class spin bowlers.</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">The origins of the game in India date to the 18th century. A touring team led by
                the English gentleman cricketer Lord Hawke played a match against the “All India” team in January 1893.
                India played its first Test in 1932 and waited 20 years for its first Test victory, against England in
                Madras (now Chennai). The game developed so fast in India, however, that by the end of the 20th century
                India was one of the world’s foremost cricketing countries. With the growth of the Indian Premier League
                in the early 21st century, it became the undisputed home of Twenty20 cricket and the financial hub of
                the international game, though the popularity of Test cricket has declined dramatically in India.
                India’s prominence in one-day cricket was further confirmed when it won the Cricket World Cup in 2011.
