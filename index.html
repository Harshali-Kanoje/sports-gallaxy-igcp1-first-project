                    <p>
                        It was in Greece that sports were first instituted formally, with the first Olympic Games
                        recorded in 776 BCE in Olympia, where they were celebrated until 393 CE. These games took
                        place
                        every four years, or Olympiad, which became a unit of time in historical chronologies.</p>
                    <p>Although it is impossible to know for sure, it is usually considered that wrestling and
                        boxing
                        were the first sports ever played. Competitions using the simple mode of human transport,
                        running, would also have been among the first sports played.</p>
