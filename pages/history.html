            <h2>Criket history</h2>
            <h2>Origin</h2>
            <br />
            <p class="history-para-1">Cricket is believed to have begun possibly as early as the 13th century as a game
                in which country
                boys bowled at a tree stump or at the hurdle gate into a sheep pen. This gate consisted of two
                uprights and a crossbar resting on the slotted tops; the crossbar was called a bail and the entire
                gate a wicket. The fact that the bail could be dislodged when the wicket was struck made this
                preferable to the stump, which name was later applied to the hurdle uprights. Early manuscripts
                differ about the size of the wicket, which acquired a third stump in the 1770s, but by 1706 the
                pitch—the area between the wickets—was 22 yards long.</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">The ball, once presumably a stone, has remained much the same since the 17th
                century. Its modern
                weight of between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (156 and 163 grams) was established in 1774 .</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">The primitive bat was no doubt a shaped branch of a tree, resembling a modern
                hockey stick but
                considerably longer and heavier. The change to a straight bat was made to defend against length
                bowling, which had evolved with cricketers in Hambledon, a small village in southern England. The
                bat was shortened in the handle and straightened and broadened in the blade, which led to forward
                play, driving, and cutting. As bowling technique was not very advanced during this period, batting
                dominated bowling through the 18th century.</p>

            <h2>International Criket</h2><br />
            <p class="history-para-1">International cricket in the early part of the 20th century was dominated by the
                original members of the
                Imperial Cricket Conference, England, Australia, and South Africa. Later renamed the International
                Cricket Conference and then the International Cricket Council, the ICC gradually took over more
                responsibility for the administration of the game and shifted its power base from west to east. When in
                2005 the ICC moved its offices from Lord’s in London—home of the MCC, the game’s original rulers and
                still its lawmakers—to Dubai, the shift away from the old ways of governance was complete. The
                priorities of the game changed too. By the turn of the 21st century, only Australia and England still
                played Test cricket to full houses. Everywhere else, and particularly in India and Pakistan, crowds
                flocked to see limited-overs internationals. Test cricket</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">became almost an afterthought. Although the power to change the laws of the game
                have remained with the MCC, the ICC developed its own Code of Conduct for players, officials, and
                administrators, which sets out disciplinary procedures and protects the spirit of the game. It also
                organized major international tournaments, including the one-day and Twenty20 World Cups and the
                Champions Trophy. In 2000 the ICC set up the Anti-Corruption Unit (renamed the Anti-Corruption Unit and
                Security Unit in 2003) to combat the growing threat of illegal gambling and match fixing. At the
                beginning of the 2010s, the ICC had 10 full members and dozens of associate and affiliate members.</p>

            <h2>Australia</h2><br />
            <p class="history-para-1">One of the founding members of the ICC, Australia remains one of its most powerful
                countries both on and off the field. The history of cricket in Australia dates to 1803 when the game was
                introduced by the crew of a British ship. The first intercolonial match took place in 1851 between
                Victoria and Tasmania, and by the end of the 19th century teams from England were touring Australia
                regularly. The first official Test match was played in Melbourne in 1877 by Australia and England,
                beginning the oldest rivalry in international cricket, a series that became known as The Ashes (see Test
                Matches below).</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">Cricket is played throughout Australia, and matches are ferociously competitive at
                every level. All the great Australian players from Sir Don Bradman to Shane Warne developed their skills
                in club cricket before graduating to the state and national teams, and the Australian style of cricket
                is marked by aggressiveness with bat, ball, and, often, voice in an attempt to intimidate opponents.
                Through the 20th century, Australia produced a series of outstanding teams, and the country dominated
                international cricket into the new century, winning three successive one-day World Cups (1999–2007) and
                twice recording runs of 16 consecutive Test victories (1999–2001 and 2005–08). In 2005 England’s Test
                victory over Australia, the first since 1987, was celebrated with an open-top bus ride through the city
                of London..</p>

            <h2>Bangladesh</h2><br />

            <br />
            <p class="history-para-1">In June 2000 Bangladesh became the 10th country to be accorded full Test status.
                It
                played its first Test match in November of that year, against India in Dhaka. Known as the Tigers, the
                Bangladeshi team struggled to perform at the highest level, winning only three of its first 68 Tests.
                However, Bangladesh has defeated the nine countries that preceded it to Test status in one-day matches,
                a
                feat completed with a victory over England in Bristol in 2010. Bangladesh’s first appearance in an
                international tournament had come in England in the ICC Trophy competition for associate members in
                1979. In
                1997 Bangladesh won the trophy and qualified for the 1999 World Cup, beating Pakistan in the group
                stages. A
                domestic first-class tournament between six regional teams was established in 2000–01. Since Bangladesh
                gained Test status, cricket arguably has become the most popular sport in the country.</p>

            <h2>India</h2><br />
            <p class="history-para-1">Cricket is played in every corner of India, on city streets, in village fields,
                and on maidans—open playing fields, the largest of which (such as the Azad, Cross, and Oval maidans in
                South Mumbai) can host dozens of overlapping matches. Historically, Indian cricketers have displayed a
                good eye and strong wrists, and Indian batsmen, most notably Sunil Gavaskar and Sachin Tendulkar, have
                been some of the most productive and stylish in the history of cricket. The dry flat pitches of the
                subcontinent have also traditionally produced high-class spin bowlers.</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">The origins of the game in India date to the 18th century. A touring team led by
                the English gentleman cricketer Lord Hawke played a match against the “All India” team in January 1893.
                India played its first Test in 1932 and waited 20 years for its first Test victory, against England in
                Madras (now Chennai). The game developed so fast in India, however, that by the end of the 20th century
                India was one of the world’s foremost cricketing countries. With the growth of the Indian Premier League
                in the early 21st century, it became the undisputed home of Twenty20 cricket and the financial hub of
                the international game, though the popularity of Test cricket has declined dramatically in India.
                India’s prominence in one-day cricket was further confirmed when it won the Cricket World Cup in 2011.

                <h4 style="text-align: center; margin: 20px;">The history behind the FIFA World Cup </h4>
                <p class="para-history-1 history-para-1">Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century.
                    Since before medieval times, “folk football” games had been played in towns and villages according
                    to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the
                    amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal
                    prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the
                    game’s status from the early 19th century onward. However, football was taken up as a winter game
                    between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton.
                    Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The
                    variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing
                    except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of
                    play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in
                    adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed
                    football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and
                    surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the
                    ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association
                    (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA.

            <h2>International organization</h2><br />
            <p class="history-para-1">Although Englishman Daniel Woolfall was elected FIFA president in 1906 and all of
                the home nations (England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales) were admitted as members by 1911, British
                football associations were disdainful of the new body. FIFA members accepted British control over the
                rules of football via the International Board, which had been established by the home nations in 1882.
                Nevertheless, in 1920 the British associations resigned their FIFA memberships after failing to persuade
                other members that Germany, Austria, and Hungary should be expelled following World War I. The British
                associations rejoined FIFA in 1924 but soon after insisted upon a very rigid definition of amateurism,
                notably for Olympic football. Other nations again failed to follow their lead, and the British resigned
                once more in 1928, remaining outside FIFA until 1946. When FIFA established the World Cup championship,
                British insouciance toward the international game continued. Without membership in FIFA, the British
                national teams were not invited to the first three competitions (1930, 1934, and 1938). For the next
                competition, held in 1950, FIFA ruled that the two best finishers in the British home nations tournament
                would qualify for World Cup play; England won, but Scotland (which finished second) chose not to compete
                for the World Cup.</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">Despite sometimes fractious international relations, football continued to rise in
                popularity. It made its official Olympic debut at the London Games in 1908, and it has since been played
                in each of the Summer Games (except for the 1932 Games in Los Angeles). FIFA also grew
                steadily—especially in the latter half of the 20th century, when it strengthened its standing as the
                game’s global authority and regulator of competition. Guinea became FIFA’s 100th member in 1961; at the
                turn of the 21st century, more than 200 nations were registered FIFA members, which is more than the
                number of countries that belong to the United Nations.

            <h2 class="common-padding">Hockey</h2><br />
            <p class="history-para-1">The history of hockey in India is a testament to the nation's deep-rooted passion
                for the sport. India has a long and illustrious relationship with hockey, and it is often referred to as
                the "National Game of India."</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">The sport was introduced to India during British colonial rule in the 19th
                century. Initially, hockey was popular among British military personnel and civil servants in India.
                However, it quickly gained popularity among Indians, and native players began participating in the
                sport.</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">In the early 20th century, Indian hockey players started making their mark on the
                international stage. The Indian Hockey Federation, now known as Hockey India, was formed in 1925, laying
                a strong foundation for the growth and development of the sport.</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">
                India's golden era in hockey started in the mid-20th century. The Indian men's hockey team won its first
                Olympic gold medal in 1928 at the Amsterdam Games, and went on to dominate the international hockey
                scene for several decades. From 1928 to 1956, India won six consecutive Olympic gold medals, an
                unparalleled achievement in the history of the sport.</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">The Indian hockey team's success can be attributed to their exceptional skills,
                innovative playing techniques, and extraordinary teamwork. They showcased a free-flowing style of play
                that was characterized by speed, precision, and creativity.</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">
                Hockey became a national obsession in India during this period, with the sport capturing the hearts of
                millions. The Indian hockey team became a symbol of national pride and unity, inspiring generations of
                players and fans alike</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">However, as the sport evolved and competition intensified, India's dominance
                started to wane. In recent years, although the Indian hockey teams have had their ups and downs, they
                continue to strive for excellence and have shown promising performances at various international
                tournaments.</p>
            <p class="history-para-1">The history of hockey in India is a blend of remarkable achievements,
                unforgettable moments, and a rich legacy that has left an indelible mark on the sport. It remains an
                integral part of India's sporting culture and continues to inspire the next generation of hockey
                players.</p>

            infrastructure and support young talent through various programs.</p>

<p class="history-para-1">The history of chess in India is absolutely fascinating! Chess, as we know it today, has its origins in ancient India and is believed to have been developed around the 6th century. The game was known as "Chaturanga," which translates to "four divisions of the military" in Sanskrit.</p>
<p class="history-para-1">During the early centuries, chess spread throughout India and was not only enjoyed as a game but also played as a strategic tool to enhance military and intellectual capabilities. The rules of the game evolved over time, eventually giving rise to the version of chess that is played globally today.
</p>
<p class="history-para-1">Chess gained importance in Indian culture, representing various aspects of life, war, and strategy. India had renowned chess players, including some royal enthusiasts, who greatly contributed to the game's popularity and development. One such notable figure was Sultan Ibrahim Adil Shah II of Bijapur, who composed the first known chess manual in the 16th century, called "Caturanga Sarvasva."</p>
<p class="history-para-1">
    As centuries passed, chess traveled beyond India's borders, finding its way to Persia, Arab lands, and eventually Europe. The modern rules and arrangement of pieces were established in Southern Europe during the 15th century.</p>
    <p class="history-para-1">Today, chess holds a prestigious position in Indian culture, with India being home to numerous grandmasters and producing some of the world's top chess players. The rich history of chess in India continues to inspire and captivate players around the globe.</p>
